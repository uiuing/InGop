# GoPlus online installer (Go+ language)

### Hi ðŸ‘‹, here is the online installer for the programming language Go+

## What is this repository doing?

Because I have a lot of friends who want to learn about Go+, 
but there are some problems for newbies to access github and install Go+.

So I had this idea: Develop a cross-platform, online support, one-click Go+ installer
