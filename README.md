# GoPlus online installer (Go+ language)

### Hi ðŸ‘‹, here is the online installer for the programming language Go+

## What is this repository doing?

Because I have a lot of friends who want to learn about Go+, 
but there are some problems for newbies to access github and install Go+.

So I had this idea: Develop a cross-platform, online support, one-click Go+ installer


## What is the current progress?

Please forgive me for developing a mac client is not in the plan for now,
as I don't have an Apple computer.

However, cross-platform is definitely supported in theory,
so you are welcome to contribute.


## Currently working on.
**windwos client**
- [ ] Installation package management
- [x] Independent environment variables
- [ ] Version management
- [ ] Exception detection (go environment, network faults)
- [x] Download acceleration


## Possible future work on.
- [ ] Automatically prepare the required environment for go+
- [ ] More stability and ease of use of the program
- [ ] More clients may be added to the program
...
