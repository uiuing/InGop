# GoPlus online installer (Go+ language)

### Hi ðŸ‘‹, here is the online installer for the programming language Go+

## What is this repository doing?

Because I have a lot of friends who want to learn about Go+, 
but there are some problems for newbies to access github and install Go+.

So I had this idea: Develop a cross-platform, online support, one-click Go+ installer

## What is the current progress?

Please forgive me for developing a mac client is not in the plan for now,
as I don't have an Apple computer.

However, cross-platform is definitely supported in theory,
so you are welcome to contribute.

> **The windows client is expected to be completed in June 2022.**

## Local run and preview

This is <a href="https://github.com/wailsapp/wails" target="_blank">Wails</a> project

Run command

```bash
wails dev
```

After that, a window will open automatically and you can see the effect here.
